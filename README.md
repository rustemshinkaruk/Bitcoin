Bitcoin Halving

In this post I will discuss the forthcoming halving of Bitcoin and why it is important.

The amount of Bitcoins in the circulation is restricted by its creator(Satoshi Nakamoto) because for a currency to be valuable it has to be scarce. The limit is set for 21 millions and currently there are 17.3 millions of bitcoins in the circulation. 

Every 10 minutes miners get rewarded with new Bitcoins, as a compensation for their efforts. At the very beginning, in 2009, miners got 50 bitcoins every 10 minutes. In order to control the supply of bitcoins, the creator set up the rules that approximately every 4 years (210000 10 minutes intervals) the number of bitcoins per 10 minutes will be halved. 

1st halving happened in November 28,2012. Number of bitcoins per 10 minutes became 25 bitcoins. 150 day return before halving was 87% and after 932%. 30 day return before halving was 16% and after 8%.

2nd halving happened in July 9, 2016. Number of bitcoins was decreased to 12.5 bitcoins per 10 minutes. 150 day return before halving was 70% and after 16%. 30 day return before halving was 13% and after -9%.


3rd halving is coming this May,2020. 150 day return before halving is 0.3%. 30 day return before halving is 24%.

In theory, when the supply of bitcoins falls and the demand stays the same, the price should go up. At the same time, some may argue that since this information is public then it should have been already embedded into the price.
